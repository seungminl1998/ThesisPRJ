<h1>September 2022, UPDATES</h1>
In this month's update, I made many changes to the hashtag page. In the last version I wrote down that I wanted to add more features to the hashtag page because the search bar became useless when I changed to Google Trends API. I also wanted to make the users be able to do research about the keyword that they were interested too. So I decided to re-subscribe to the Hashtag API used before and also now, InSEO can get the most popular posts to the related keyword from Instagram. For instance, if the users type "coding" in the search bar and click the search button, they will get two pop-ups. One pop-up will be containing the most popular posts related to "coding" in Instagram and the other pop-up will show the suggested or related keywords with the number of posts.

<h3>Hashtag Page</h3>
The captions page is the last page I made where the users will be able to see their saved captions. In this page the users will be able to add and delete their caption ideas to be added in their future posts.
