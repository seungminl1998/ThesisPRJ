<h2>Reason of Project</h2>

The reason why I started this project was because I myself am a YoutTube and Instagram influencer. <br>
 
> In YouTube I have more than 20,000 subscribers and in Instagram I have more than 4,000 followers.
            
The most important job in order to succeed in YouTube was to understand the YouTube algorithm and make it work for your channel. In order to make this happen, I needed to optimize the meta-data of my channel and the meta-data of each video in my channel. This was because I needed to make the YouTube algorithm understand what kind of videos I was making in order to show it to the correct audience to **increase watch time**, **click-through rates**, **views**, **likes** and **comments**.<br><br> If my videos reached the correct audience, I always got good number of watch time, click-through rates, views, likes and comments which lead to the algorithm to expose my videos more. However, I needed help in order to make my videos get the correct audience. Meaning, I needed help to make the meta-datas correct so that the algorithm could understand my video more to reach out to the correct audience. The process was as the following: <br>
- make the video 
- upload the video
- insert the metadata <br>

Here, when talking about metadata, there are the following information:
- Title
- Description
- Video tags

<h2>Result of Related Projects</h2>
The most important metadata in order to make the algorithm understand the video is the video tags. In order to search for tags I needed to go to internet, pay for an application that recommended me for tags, and then insert them into my video metadata. <br><br> However, an application called TubeBuddy came out and everything got much more easy which also made my videos go better. TubeBuddy is an application that recommended tags for the video and also shows the video creator the grade of the video itself. Moreover, after showing the grade, TubeBuddy also recommends us what we should do in order to improve the video. This helped me a lot and I thought why there was nothing like this for instagram influencers. <br><br>
      
      There is TubeBuddy for YouTube influencers, but they were none for Instagram Influencers.
       
 I use both platforms hence, I decided to make one for Instagram Influencers which is the current thesis project, Instagram Search Engine Optimization (InSEO).
InSEO is a need for the market because people also earn and make a living being an instagram influencer. Reaching out the correct audience could help them increase their popularity and moreover, make users get more engaged in the platform itsel which would make the instagram algorithm promote more posts of the corresponding user. I also find it difficult to search for trending hashtags, and it is difficult for me to analyze how good are the metadatas of my instagram post. This is what InSEO does for the users.

<h2>Business Model for InSEO</h2>

Social Media is and will be a big part of people’s life because it is what builds communities and connects people from all around the world. This started to spread in 2008 when Facebook came to life and marked the start of the growth of the social media platforms.

When making this application, my main goal was to make a business out of it. Hence, I invested on the project as explained above and made a business plan. The image below shows the business plan of this project InSEO.

The box in the middle which says InSEO is our web application. The box that is left to it which contains “Facebook Graph API” is the back end API used to fetch the connected user’s posts and data. Lastly, the user box that is to the far right is our customer and our main income stream.

First, the users will enter to our web application and buy the product. The users will pay a monthly ₩3,000 to use the application. This is because InSEO is also using money for the APIs in order to provide a better service to instagram influencers. After they buy the product, InSEO will register the user in the Facebook Graph API and we will give the customer the access token in order for them to be able to register. Hence, our main income stream would be the monthly subscription of the instagram influencers in order to use the service.
<h2>The Needs</h2>

Social Media is and will be a big part of people’s life because it is what builds communities and connects people from all around the world. This started to spread in 2008 when Facebook came to life and marked the start of the growth of the social media platforms.


People realized that money could be made by using it and currently there are more than 50 million people that consider themselves as “Creators”. Creators are those who create contents that people watch to get entertained and by entertaining others they gain money. This is possible because social media platforms need users, being more specific users that constantly come back. This can be achieved by having new contents which are made by “Creators”.<br>

Nowadays, children’s one of the top dream job is to be a “Creator”. This is because one can earn a lot of money by just making videos about things that you like to do. However, it is not easy to be successful being a creator because a lot of people are in this market. In other words, it is a red ocean. People need to upload good content constantly and moreover, they need to have some kind of strategy. Furthermore, they need to have good organization of their insights in order to know what they’re doing wrong and what they’re doing right. The following datas are used in order to check if a creator’s content is good content:<br>
- retention rate
- click-through rate
- subscription rate
- number of impressions.<br>

This is the data used in YouTube in order to tell if it is a good content or not. However, this is not the same for every social media platform as YouTube is a video based content platform but Instagram is a picture based content platform. Instagram creators use the following datas in order to check if the content is good or not:<br>
- likes follower ratio
- comments per like ratio 
- impression reach rate <br>
