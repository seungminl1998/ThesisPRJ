<h1>Graduation Thesis Project (성균관대학교), 2022</h1>
This is the Thesis Project Documentation page for <b>SKKU Seungmin LEE</b>.

The project is called **InSEO**, short for Instagram Search Engine Optimization, which will be a service for Instagram Influencers.
By the ends of this project, the web application will be able to grade the posts of an influencer so that they can see how well they are doing.

If this application is presented to the market, the Instagram Influencers will be able to have a better experience when uploading their instagram posts. 
It will be easier for them to manage their post and profile and they will also be able to see their profile grade which will make them easier to know how well they are doing.

<h2>The Needs</h2>
Social Media is and will be a big part of people’s life because it is what builds communities and connects people from all around the world. This started to spread in 2008 when Facebook came to life and marked the start of the growth of the social media platforms.


People realized that money could be made by using it and currently there are more than 50 million people that consider themselves as “Creators”. Creators are those who create contents that people watch to get entertained and by entertaining others they gain money. This is possible because social media platforms need users, being more specific users that constantly come back. This can be achieved by having new contents which are made by “Creators”.<br>

Nowadays, children’s one of the top dream job is to be a “Creator”. This is because one can earn a lot of money by just making videos about things that you like to do. However, it is not easy to be successful being a creator because a lot of people are in this market. In other words, it is a red ocean. People need to upload good content constantly and moreover, they need to have some kind of strategy. Furthermore, they need to have good organization of their insights in order to know what they’re doing wrong and what they’re doing right. The following datas are used in order to check if a creator’s content is good content:<br>
- retention rate
- click-through rate
- subscription rate
- number of impressions.<br>

This is the data used in YouTube in order to tell if it is a good content or not. However, this is not the same for every social media platform as YouTube is a video based content platform but Instagram is a picture based content platform. Instagram creators use the following datas in order to check if the content is good or not:<br>
- likes follower ratio
- comments per like ratio 
- impression reach rate <br>

*** IMPORTANT:
        **THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE OPENED FOR OTHER INSTAGRAM INFLUENCERS**.
        
The project's progress will be written in the **README.md** file in each month with its corresponding source codes.
