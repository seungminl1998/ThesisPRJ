<h1>Graduation Thesis Project (성균관대학교), 2022</h1>
This is the Thesis Project Documentation page for <u>SKKU Seungmin LEE</u>.

The project is called **InSEO**, short for Instagram Search Engine Optimization, which will be a service for Instagram Influencers.
By the ends of this project, the web application will be able to grade the posts of an influencer so that they can see how well they are doing.

If this application is presented to the market, the Instagram Influencers will be able to have a better experience when uploading their instagram posts. 
It will be easier for them to manage their post and profile and they will also be able to see their profile grade which will make them easier to know how well they are doing.

*** IMPORTANT:
        **THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE OPENED FOR OTHER INSTAGRAM INFLUENCERS**.
        
The project's progress will be written in the **README.md** file in each month with its corresponding source codes.
