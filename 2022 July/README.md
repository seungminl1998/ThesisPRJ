<h1>July 2022, UPDATES</h1>
In this month's update, I fixed some bugs of the project and also I made a plan to make the users be able to register to the app. In the last version, I was the only person who could use the application because we had to define the access key, instagram page id, and the facebook
I made that each user could buy the product for the key and register. Each user has captions and hashtags of their own.
