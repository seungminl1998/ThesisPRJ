<h1>MAY 2022, UPDATES</h1>
I am making the front end and the back end of the <b>Application InSEO</b>.

>This month I bought the domain "inseo.co.kr" in order to make the OAUTH call to Facebook and make facebook login available.

I registered to a hosting service with linux light in order to get to use a database (MySQL) and also to use PHP to connect to the server. For a reminder in this project I am using the following languages:<br>
**    1. HTML<br>
    2. JAVASCRIPT (JQUERY)<br>
    3. CSS<br>
    4. PHP<br>**
