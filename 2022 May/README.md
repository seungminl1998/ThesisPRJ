>The hosting service was registered using **WHOIS Hosting Service**.

I registered to a hosting service with linux light in order to get to use a database (MySQL) and also to use PHP to connect to the server. For a reminder in this project I am using the following languages:<br>
   - **HTML**<br>
   - **JAVASCRIPT (JQUERY)**<br>
   - **CSS**<br
   - **PHP**<br>

Moroever, in order to be able to get the instagram post insights, I bought the SSL Security Certificate **Sectigo Basic DV Single**. This allows my web page to use "HTTPS" which is a must in order to use the Instagram Graph API which is the API needed to get the post insights.
