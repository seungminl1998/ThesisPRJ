I am making the front end of the Application InSEO.
InSEO is an application that will be made for instagram influencers however for this project, it will just be used by the creator, myself, because
an upgraded version of the API which is paid. However, the alogrithm that will calculate the post's grade will be there which can be used by other users
if they provide the creator the token and user ID.
