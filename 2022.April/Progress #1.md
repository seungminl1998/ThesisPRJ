I am making the front end of the Application InSEO.
InSEO is a service that will be made for instagram influencers however for this project, it will just be used by the creator, myself, because
an upgraded version of the API which is paid. However, the alogrithm that will calculate the post's grade will be there which can be used by other users
if they provide the creator the token and user ID.

The image below is an image of the home page of the service:

For this project I am using HTML, CSS, JQUERY, JSP, and MySQL.

CHANGES IN PLAN (WEEK #2)
In week#1, I tried to make the front end for my website.
I was wondering how I was going to finish this project and also started studying how to use the Facebook API.
Which then I learned that it would be more comfortable to use PHP for this project instead of JSP.
Hence, I decided to use PHP.
