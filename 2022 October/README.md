<h1>October 2022, UPDATES</h1>

In this month I made the web application look good in smart phones. Moreover, users now cannot go back to the login screen until they click the logout button. The professor gave me the idea of executing the Facebook OAUTH only the first time the user logs in into InSEO. This is because it would be bothering for the user authenticate using facebook each time they log in into the application. Moreover, users cannot go back to the login screen until they click the logout button or until the session ends.
